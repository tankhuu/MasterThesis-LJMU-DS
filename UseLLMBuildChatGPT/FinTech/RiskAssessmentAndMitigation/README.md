## Suggestion from ChatGPT

For your thesis on using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for risk assessment and mitigation in banking, as well as providing time support, automated reporting, and scheduling to improve customer experience, you will need a financial dataset related to banking that includes details relevant to risk assessment. This could include transactional data, customer information, risk scoring, or loan and credit information.

Here are some key sources and datasets that could be useful for your project:

1. Credit Risk and Loan Data
Home Credit Default Risk Dataset (Kaggle): This dataset contains data on loans, including whether customers defaulted on their loans. It’s useful for building risk assessment models. Data includes client information, credit history, income, and social/economic factors.
LendingClub Loan Data (Kaggle): This dataset provides information about loans issued by LendingClub. It includes fields like loan amount, interest rate, borrower income, and loan status (paid off, defaulted, etc.), which can be used to assess financial risk.
Give Me Some Credit (Kaggle): This dataset offers credit scores for various individuals, and you can use it for predictive modeling of credit risk.
2. Banking Transaction Data
Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection (Kaggle): This dataset simulates mobile banking transactions and is designed for fraud detection research. It includes transaction types, amounts, sender/recipient info, and time features.
IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (Kaggle): Although focused on fraud detection, this dataset provides a vast amount of transaction data, which could be used to model risk profiles and predict anomalies.
3. Market and Economic Data (for Macroeconomic Risk Assessment)
World Bank Open Data (World Bank): This repository offers global financial data such as GDP, inflation rates, and unemployment rates, which can be used in conjunction with banking data for macroeconomic risk assessments.
Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) (Federal Reserve): FRED provides financial data such as interest rates, stock market indices, and other financial metrics. These can be useful for understanding market risks in banking.
4. Risk Assessment Frameworks and Benchmark Data
Moody’s Analytics Credit Risk Database (Paid Service): If you have access to this or can arrange for academic licensing, Moody’s provides large-scale banking data focused on credit risk.
RiskDataHub (Free): Focuses on operational risks and offers a wide range of datasets related to risk mitigation across various sectors.
5. Synthetic Banking Data
Synthetic Financial Dataset For Benchmarking (Kaggle): If you're having trouble finding real banking data due to privacy concerns, this synthetic dataset simulates financial transactions and can serve as a good alternative for developing risk models.

Key Considerations:

Privacy and Compliance: Financial data, especially for risk assessment, may contain sensitive personal information (PII). If you are using real-world banking data, ensure that it complies with regulations like GDPR (for the EU) or CCPA (for California). Synthetic data can help sidestep these issues.
Preprocessing: Financial datasets often require cleaning and transformation. This might involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., loan status), and scaling numeric features (e.g., transaction amounts).

Would you like guidance on how to process these datasets, or help in integrating them with LLMs for your specific use case? Let me know!
