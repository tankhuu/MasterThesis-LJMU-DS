# Developing a ChatGPT-based Virtual Assistant for Fetal Health Monitoring

Objective: Build a chatbot using LLMs to assist pregnant women in monitoring fetal health. The chatbot can provide real-time insights, personalized advice, and answer health-related questions based on maternal inputs such as symptoms, medical history, or sensor data (e.g., from wearables).

Key Areas:

Natural language understanding of health-related questions.
Integration of data from wearable devices that track fetal movements, heart rate, etc.
Identifying risk factors (e.g., based on symptoms) and suggesting medical interventions.
Data Sources:

Datasets from health surveys or clinical trials that monitor fetal health.
Synthetic or real-time data from fetal heart rate monitors.
