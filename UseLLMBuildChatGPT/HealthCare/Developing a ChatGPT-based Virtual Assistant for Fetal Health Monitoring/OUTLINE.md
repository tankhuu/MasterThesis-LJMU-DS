Thesis Outline: Developing a ChatGPT-based Virtual Assistant for Fetal Health Monitoring
This outline provides a structured approach to your thesis, which focuses on creating a virtual assistant using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to help pregnant women monitor fetal health, offering real-time support and guidance based on symptoms, health history, and clinical data.

1. Introduction
Background and Motivation:
Discuss the importance of fetal health monitoring during pregnancy and the challenges faced by expecting mothers (e.g., limited access to healthcare, lack of real-time advice).
Highlight the rise of virtual health assistants and their potential in prenatal care, improving accessibility, and reducing maternal anxiety.
Introduce the concept of using LLMs (ChatGPT) to create a personalized fetal health monitoring assistant.
Problem Statement:
Many pregnant women lack access to timely advice or monitoring, leading to missed warnings or unnecessary anxiety. The goal is to create a real-time, AI-based assistant to support them.
Objectives:
Build a ChatGPT-based virtual assistant that provides fetal health insights based on user inputs (symptoms, history, and wearable data).
Integrate data from maternal health records or wearable devices to offer personalized advice.
Scope and Limitations:
Focus on symptom-based monitoring and advisory services for non-emergency conditions.
Limitations include data privacy concerns and the assistant not serving as a replacement for medical advice.
2. Literature Review
Fetal Health Monitoring Systems:
Review existing solutions (e.g., mobile apps, IoT devices, fetal monitors) for tracking fetal health.
AI and LLMs in Healthcare:
Explore existing research on LLMs, such as GPT-based models in healthcare applications (symptom checkers, virtual assistants, etc.).
Current Gaps:
Discuss gaps in available fetal monitoring systems, such as lack of real-time conversational support or limited integration of personalized advice.
3. Proposed Methodology
System Architecture:
High-level overview of how the virtual assistant will work. Components include:
User Input Interface: Allows mothers to enter symptoms, ask questions, or provide data from wearables (e.g., fetal movement trackers, heart rate monitors).
ChatGPT Model: Processes natural language inputs, analyzes the information, and generates responses based on knowledge of fetal health.
Data Integration Module: Integrates additional clinical data or inputs from wearable devices (e.g., fetal heart rate, maternal vitals).
Response Generation and Personalization: Personalized advice and insights based on health data and historical information.
Data Sources:
Sources of fetal health data for training or testing the model:
Symptom databases related to pregnancy and fetal health.
Public datasets on fetal health indicators such as heart rate, fetal movement, and maternal health.
Integration of wearable device data (simulated or real) for tracking fetal movements or vitals.
Implementation Plan:
Chatbot Interface: Develop a conversational interface for mothers to interact with the assistant.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and structure the fetal health data to be used by ChatGPT for effective response generation.
Model Customization: Fine-tune GPT for medical information related to fetal health to ensure accuracy and relevance of responses.
4. Dataset Selection and Description
Fetal Health Monitoring Data:
Datasets for training/testing the model. Potential data sources include:
Fetal Health Classification Dataset (Kaggle):
Provides cardiotocography (CTG) data used to classify fetal health status (normal, suspect, pathological).
Features: Fetal heart rate (FHR), uterine contractions, accelerations, and decelerations.
Maternal Health Risk Data (Kaggle):
Contains maternal health attributes like blood pressure, glucose levels, and heart rate that can be used to assess risk to fetal health.
UCI CTG Dataset:
Cardiotocographic measurements of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Labeled as "normal", "suspect", or "pathological."
Wearable Device Simulated Data:
Use simulated data from wearable fetal monitoring devices for real-time tracking of fetal heart rate and movement.
Data Augmentation:
Augment data through synthetic means or simulate additional fetal movement/heart rate patterns using known medical models to improve the variety of inputs for the LLM.
5. Model Training and Fine-Tuning
Training ChatGPT:
Fine-tune the pre-trained GPT model using datasets specific to fetal health, ensuring it can handle symptom queries, provide accurate responses, and offer risk assessments.
Evaluation Metrics:
Use medical accuracy metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) for evaluating the accuracy of health-related responses.
Human feedback evaluation: Evaluate the chatbot by conducting a user study with feedback from pregnant women and healthcare professionals.
6. Results and Discussion
Model Performance:
Discuss the chatbot’s ability to interpret user inputs, diagnose common fetal health conditions, and provide appropriate advice.
Case Studies:
Present case studies using real or simulated user interactions to demonstrate the system’s performance.
Limitations:
Discuss the limitations of the chatbot, such as the reliance on user-reported symptoms, potential inaccuracies without direct clinical data, or model bias.
Comparison to Other Systems:
Compare the virtual assistant’s capabilities with existing fetal health monitoring tools or apps.
7. Conclusion and Future Work
Summary of Findings:
Recap the effectiveness of the ChatGPT-based assistant in providing personalized, real-time fetal health monitoring.
Future Improvements:
Consider integrating the assistant with hospital information systems or further training with real-time data from wearables or hospital devices.
Potential for Clinical Applications:
Discuss the possibility of extending the model for clinical use in hospitals or remote monitoring for at-risk pregnancies.
