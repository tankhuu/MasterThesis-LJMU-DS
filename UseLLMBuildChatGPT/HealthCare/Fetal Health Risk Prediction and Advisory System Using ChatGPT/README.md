# Fetal Health Risk Prediction and Advisory System Using ChatGPT

Objective: Leverage LLMs to develop a risk prediction tool that identifies potential health risks (such as premature birth, low birth weight, or birth defects) based on input data from medical reports, ultrasound results, and patient queries. The system would provide personalized advice and automatically generate risk mitigation plans for expecting mothers.

Key Areas:

Text-based medical data analysis, like interpreting ultrasound reports, lab results, or symptoms.
Risk assessment using natural language inputs from mothers (symptoms, concerns) combined with clinical data.
Generation of personalized reports and recommendations.
Data Sources:

Fetal Health Classification Dataset (available on Kaggle): This dataset focuses on fetal health monitoring using cardiotocograms (CTG) data.
Clinical fetal health databases with diagnostic and risk factors (e.g., preterm labor datasets, prenatal medical records).
